these two are algorithms to find the shortest path within a tree

With BFS, which also finds the shortest path, we do not take into account the weight of a path

Dijkstra: Faster than Bellman-Ford and BFS, but cant account weights between nodes.

Bellman-Ford: is very effective at solving the shortest path becomes works with negative weight (Dijkstra is not able to). Can take a long time to determine the shortest path. Big O => O(n^2).
